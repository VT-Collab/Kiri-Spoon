# Kiri-Spoon
Kiri-Spoon: A Kirigami Utensil for Robot-Assisted Feeding

There are prt, assem, and step files in the Kiri Assembly Folder
The prt and assem files are editable files of the KiriSpoon design
The step files are the versions of the design we used in our testing
If you want to edit our KiriSpoon assembly, you will need to download all prt and assem files
