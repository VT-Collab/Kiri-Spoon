# Kiri-Spoon: A Kirigami Utensil for Robot-Assisted Feeding

The main kirigami sheet A is **KiriFilm_1_Rib1_Film1.5.SLDPRT**.

There are prt, assem, and step files in the Kiri Assembly Folder.

The prt and assem files are editable files of the KiriSpoon design.

The step files are the versions of the design we used in our testing.

If you want to edit our KiriSpoon assembly, you will need to download all prt and assem files.\
